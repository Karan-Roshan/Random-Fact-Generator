# Random Useless Facts Generator (Python)
A simple and fun Python project that fetches **random useless facts** from an online API and displays them in the terminal.  
This project is beginner-friendly and great for learning **API requests, functions, and user input validation** in Python.


## Project Overview
This script allows users to choose how many random facts they want to see.  
The program then fetches and displays those facts one by one using a public API.


## Features
- Fetches random facts using an API
- User-defined number of facts
- Input validation (minimum 1, maximum 7)
- Clean and easy-to-read code
- Beginner-friendly project


## How It Works
1. The user enters a number (between 1 and 7)
2. The script sends a request to the API
3. Each fact is displayed with numbering

## Sample Output
<p align="center">
  <img src="Generator (Preview).png" 
       alt="Generator Preview" 
       >
</p>


##  Input Validation Rules
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">

    <tr>
      <th>Input Range</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Less than 1</td>
      <td>Minimum number of facts per execution is 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Greater than 7</td>
      <td>Maximum number of facts per execution is 7</td>
    </tr>
